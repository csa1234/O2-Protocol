# O2-Protocol Contracts

Welcome to the O2-Protocol Contracts repository! This readme provides an overview of the contracts and their functionalities.

## Contracts Description

The `contracts` folder contains the smart contracts for the O2-Protocol project. Here's a brief description of the contracts:

- **Token.sol**: This contract implements the O2 token. It includes functions for token creation, transfer, and balance retrieval.
- **Crowdsale.sol**: This contract handles the crowdsale of O2 tokens. It includes functions for token purchase, pricing, and token distribution.

## Usage

To use the O2-Protocol Contracts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/csa1234/O2-Protocol.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the contracts**: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the `contracts` folder in the `O2-Protocol` repository directory. This is where the contract code is located.

3. **Compile the contracts**: Use your preferred Solidity development environment to compile the contracts. Ensure that there are no compilation errors and that the contracts are successfully compiled.

4. **Deploy the contracts**: Deploy the contracts using your preferred Ethereum development environment or blockchain network. Make sure to deploy the contracts in the correct order (e.g., Token.sol before Crowdsale.sol) and provide any necessary constructor arguments.
